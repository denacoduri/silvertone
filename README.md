[Silvertone Analytics](https://www.silvertoneanalytics.com/) is a boutique consulting firm that helps clients make data-driven decisions. They also sell digital analytics courses. Excel data was provided by Silvertone as a challenge to create a [Tableau KPI dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/denacoduri/viz/SilvertoneAnalyticsCourseAdAnalysis/Story1) with their YouTube course ad data from September 10 - September 16, 2021.

I cleaned the data in Excel, adding extra columns to experiment with different potential profit models. This was based upon a projected 2% of clicks converting to a sale, and a selling price of $200 per course.
